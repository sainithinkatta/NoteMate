NoteMate 

1. Project Overview
NoteMate is a full-stack application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that enables users to securely sign up, log in, and manage their notes. The platform allows users to create, edit, update, and delete notes with ease, offering rich text formatting and categorization options.
The app features a dynamic, responsive front-end built with React.js, leveraging React Router for smooth navigation and Context API for global state management. The backend is powered by Express.js, with RESTful API routes to handle authentication (using JWT tokens for secure login), CRUD operations for notes, and user session management.
MongoDB serves as the database for persistent storage of user credentials and notes data, utilizing Mongoose for schema validation and efficient query handling. NoteMate also includes functionality to pin important notes to the homepage for quick access, ensuring a streamlined and personalized user experience.
